# LQTrader
LQTrader is a Windows Desktop application that allows trading equities, fx, indexes, futures and options in the [Matba-Rofex](https://www.matbarofex.com.ar/) financial market of Argentina. This application was certified by [Primary](https://primary.com.ar/) in March, 2020.
It had been developed in C# using .NET Framework 4.7.2 and Entity Framework 6 and recently I migrated it to NET 6 and EF Core 6.
